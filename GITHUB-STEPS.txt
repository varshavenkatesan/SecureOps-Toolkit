GITHUB DEPLOYMENT - SIMPLE STEPS
=================================

Follow these steps EXACTLY to deploy your SecureOps Toolkit to GitHub:

STEP 1: CREATE GITHUB REPOSITORY
---------------------------------
1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: https://github.com/new
3. Fill in:
   - Repository name: SecureOps-Toolkit
   - Description: Educational Python-based security toolkit featuring File Integrity Monitoring, Web Vulnerability Scanner, and Penetration Testing tools
   - Visibility: Public (recommended) or Private
   - DO NOT check any boxes (no README, no .gitignore, no license)
4. Click "Create repository"
5. Leave the page open (you'll need the URL)


STEP 2: RUN POWERSHELL COMMANDS
---------------------------------
Open PowerShell and run these commands ONE BY ONE:

# Navigate to project directory
cd C:\SecureOps-Toolkit

# Initialize Git
git init

# Configure Git (replace with YOUR details)
git config user.name "Varsha Venkatesan"
git config user.email "your-email@example.com"

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: SecureOps Toolkit v1.0.0 by Varsha Venkatesan"

# Add GitHub remote (REPLACE YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username!)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SecureOps-Toolkit.git

# Set main branch
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main


ALTERNATIVE: USE THE AUTOMATED SCRIPT
--------------------------------------
Instead of typing commands manually, you can run:

powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File deploy-to-github.ps1

This will guide you through the process interactively.


STEP 3: VERIFY DEPLOYMENT
--------------------------
1. Go to: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SecureOps-Toolkit
2. Check that all files are visible
3. Verify README.md displays correctly
4. Check folder structure is intact


STEP 4: ENHANCE YOUR REPOSITORY
--------------------------------
On your GitHub repository page:

1. Click "About" ⚙️ (top right of repository)
2. Add description:
   "🔒 Educational Security Toolkit: File Integrity Monitoring, Web Vulnerability Scanner (SQL Injection/XSS), Port Scanner & Brute Force Simulator. Python-based, beginner-friendly."

3. Add topics (click "Add topics"):
   - cybersecurity
   - python
   - security-tools
   - penetration-testing
   - vulnerability-scanner
   - educational
   - ethical-hacking
   - owasp

4. Click "Save changes"


STEP 5: ADD LICENSE (OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED)
-----------------------------------------------
1. On your repository page, click "Add file" → "Create new file"
2. Name it: LICENSE
3. Click "Choose a license template"
4. Select "MIT License" or create custom educational license
5. Update year and name to: 2026 Varsha Venkatesan
6. Click "Review and submit"
7. Commit the file
